        <ul>
          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the "var" keyword followed by giving the variable a name</li>
          <li>The ".js" file extension indicates that this file is a JavaScript file</li>
          <li>Create a new feature branch for the JS file by entering "git checkout -b feature/add-js" into the command line</li>
          <li>Create a new file inside the assets folder called "script.js" by entering "touch script.js" in the command line</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon (;)</li>
          <li>the "console.log" method is used to output a message to the web console by adding an argument; "console.log" will output the value of "topics" to the web console because we've added it as an argument inside the parentheses</li>
          <li>To link the "script.js" file to the "index.html" file, add the code under the "footer" element and above the closing element for "body"</li>
          <li>In order to see changes that we made with JavaScript, we need to use Chrome DevTools</li>
          <li>Order of the code affects the outcome since JavaScript is read from top to bottom</li>
          <li>A value is considered "falsy" if it is: "0," "-0," "On," " ," "null," "undefine," "Nan," or a Boolean data type value with the value of false"</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data and are typically used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
          <li>All other values, including a Boolean witht he value of "true," are considered "truthy"</li>
